Its 15th March 2024, I am studying in 2nd year 4th Semester and I know basically nothing about JavaScript, but still I made a working calculator using ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot.

Also learned how to use Git version control:

I leaned these commands -

```
git add .
```

```
git commit -m "Message"
```

```
git push origin main
```
